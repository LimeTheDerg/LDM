**********LIME'S DAEMON MANAGER**********
Lime's daemon manager, or simply LDM is a lightweight and easy to use daemon managing CLI application. It is capable of starting/stopping/configuring several different daemon binaries
and listening to them all at once through the listener.

Furthermore, users can create their own daemons very easily with the help of the daemon API. Refer to the proper documentation at: https://github.com/LimeTheDerg/LDM

The tool is split up into two programs, the interface and the listener. The interface is responsible for spawning, killing, and configuring daemons while
the listener is responsible for listening to all active daemons at once.

COMMANDS:
    ldmi - The interface, used to start, stop, and configure daemons.
    ldml - The listener, listens to all active daemons and relays information to the user in the command line.

INTERFACE USAGE:
    ldmi help
        Displays this message

    ldmi list
        Displays all available daemons

    ldmi start <daemon-name>
        Starts the daemon with name <daemon-name>
        EXAMPLE: ldmi start cpu-temperature-monitor

    ldmi stop <daemon-name>
        Terminates the daemon with name <daemon-name>
        EXAMPLE: ldmi stop cpu-temperature-monitor

    ldmi config <daemon-name>
        Displays the configuration specification of <daemon-name> and requests a configuration from the user where arguments are space separated
        Then configures the daemon with name <daemon-name>
        Daemons must be restarted for the config to take effect
        Refer to daemon documentation or use intuition
        EXAMPLE:
        ldmi config vault
        >>> <clear-vault-delay-seconds> <default-value>
        300 empty

    ldmi send <daemon-name>
        Asks the user for the message they would like to send
        Sends the message to <daemon-name>
        EXAMPLE:
        ldmi send vault
        >> Enter the message you would like to send:
        password123

    ldmi help <daemon-name>
        Displays information about the daemon, with its description and specifications

LISTENER USAGE:
    ldml
        Opens the listener to read messages from all active daemons
        The listener does not take any input
